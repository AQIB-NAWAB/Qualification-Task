```

## Installing Dependencies

Run the following command inside the project directory:

cp .env.example .env
```

This will create a new `.env` file in the project root. Open the file and update the following values:

## General

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run. Default is `3000`.

- GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL: The email address of the service account.
- GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of the service account.
- GOOGLE_SHEET_ID: The ID of the Google Sheet to be used.


These all values can be found in the downloaded JSON file.

### On Windows (Powershell or CMD)

```sh
npm start
```

### On Linux/macOS

```sh
npm run start
```

If using Docker:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

## Expected Output

Once the server is running, you should see an output similar to:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
Database connected successfully
```

You can visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized production files.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency issues, try running:
  ```sh
  npm audit fix --force
  ```
- If the server doesnâ€™t start, ensure all required environment variables are set properly.

## Additional Notes

For Windows users, if facing permission issues, try running commands with **Administrator privileges**.
